## **About the Project**

**Equity News Research Tool** is an AI-powered application that leverages **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to assist in researching and summarizing news articles, particularly focused on equity and financial markets. It allows users to input URLs of news articles, process the content, and ask questions related to the news. The tool utilizes **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **FAISS** for document retrieval, question-answering, and presenting relevant sources.

The **RAG** approach enhances the language generation model by combining it with information retrieval, allowing for more accurate, relevant, and contextually rich responses.

## **Key Features**
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines a powerful retrieval mechanism with generative language models for precise answers.
- **Multiple News Articles**: Accepts up to 3 URLs for news article processing.
- **Embeddings and Search**: Leverages FAISS for embedding news content and performing efficient searches.
- **Interactive Question-Answering**: Ask questions about the processed articles and get answers with sources.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python** 3.8+
- **LangChain** `v0.0.284`
- **Streamlit** `v1.22.0`
- **OpenAI API** `v0.28.0`
- **FAISS-CPU** `v1.7.4`
- **Tiktoken** `v0.4.0`
- **Unstructured** `v0.9.2`

## **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed.
- Obtain an **OpenAI API key** to use GPT-based language models.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/equity-news-research-tool.git
    cd equity-news-research-tool
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

5. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## **Usage**

1. Enter up to 3 URLs for news articles in the sidebar.
2. Click the **Process URLs** button to load, split, and process the articles.
3. After processing, ask any questions related to the news articles using the text input field.
4. The tool will display answers generated by the AI and also list the sources used.

### Example:

- **Input**:  
  _"What are the key takeaways from these articles?"_
  
- **Output**:  
  A detailed answer derived from the processed articles, along with references to the relevant sources.

### Saved FAISS Index:
- After processing, the embeddings are saved as a FAISS index (`faiss_store_openai.pkl`) for quick reuse.
- This enables fast retrieval and searching within the indexed documents, ensuring efficient query response times.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Support for More Input Formats**: Add options to upload PDFs, text files, or scraped web data.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Provide graphical summaries, trends, or visual highlights from the processed news articles.
- **User Authentication**: Allow multiple users to create profiles and track their research history.
- **Real-Time Data**: Include options to pull data from live news APIs for real-time research.
